## 📋 Project Description

The goal of this project is to detect phishing emails automatically using machine learning.  
The workflow involves loading and combining multiple phishing datasets, cleaning the email text, vectorizing using TF-IDF, training a Logistic Regression model, and evaluating using confusion matrix, precision-recall curve, and ROC curve.

## 🔥 Workflow

1. Load 7 different phishing datasets
2. Preprocess text (lowercase, remove URLs, numbers, punctuation)
3. Combine all datasets
4. Vectorize using TF-IDF (Top 5000 features)
5. Train-Test Split (80%-20%)
6. Train Logistic Regression
7. Evaluate using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision-Recall Curve
   - ROC Curve
8. Save trained model and vectorizer for future use
